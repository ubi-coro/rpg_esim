## Python Bindings

Python bindings for the event camera simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_vid2e). 
We now also support GPU support for fully parallel event generation!


## Features

- Accurate event simulation, guaranteed by the tight integration between the rendering engine and the event simulator
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) simulation
- Support for multi-camera systems
- Ground truth camera poses, IMU biases, angular/linear velocities, depth maps, and optic flow maps
- Support for camera distortion (only planar and panoramic renderers)
- Different C+/C- contrast thresholds
- Basic noise simulation for event cameras (based on additive Gaussian noise on the contrast threshold)
- Motion blur simulation
- Publish to ROS and/or save data to rosbag
